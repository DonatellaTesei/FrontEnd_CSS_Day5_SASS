        <h1>7 MOST FAMOUS PAINTINGS IN THE WORLD</h1><br>
        <p class="date">January 15, 2023 by <a href="">DonaT</a></p>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Some of the best known paintings in the world were created during the Renaissance, a cultural movement in Europe that spanned roughly from the 14th century to the 17th century; and was marked by renewed interest in the culture of the ancient
                Greeks and the ancient Romans.</p>
            <p>
                The most famous Renaissance paintings include The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli; and Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. Modern Art began in France in the 1850s and later spread to other nations. The Realists portrayed, with uncompromising truth and
                accuracy, the people and situations of the present.

                Realism was followed by Impressionism, another French movement, which focused on capturing the momentary effect of a scene rather than accurately depicting it. This was followed by various innovations in the 20th century including Cubism which was characterized
                by the use of geometric planes and shapes. Modern Art saw unparalleled development in the art world and some of the best known paintings were produced by artists of this age. These include The Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh, Picasso’s
                Guernica, Dali’s The Persistence of Memory and The Scream by Edvard Munch. Here are the 7 most famous paintings in the world.
